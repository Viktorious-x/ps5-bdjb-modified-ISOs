WARNING! Remember to close disk player after you get alot of etahen notifications cuz after that its kstuff which causes system to crash when it gets loaded in disk player

As always thank you echostretch and LM for kstuff and Etahen! Also thanks hammer 83 for jar loader, iakdev for usb loader and pipeline loader! thanks to cryonumb for bdj elf loader! Thanks John TÃ¶rnblom for ftpsrv and websrv!
 Hope this helps and have fun! Thanks for all the people who made this possible! Also thanks Driverick (original modded iso creator) and 54f3ty (Elon Musk) for helping me make this!

Pipelines are a sequence of payloads run so it will run the payloads all in one sequence so you dont have to do it yourself, its easier and faster and automated that way.

theres 8 pipelines in total, I will divide it into 3 categories: ALl-IN-ONE, Jailbreak-ONLY and NO-etaHEN

All the pipelines have 2 versions of them, umtx1 and umtx2. I highly reccomend umtx1, but if you dont care about a higher chance of kp and want faster times use the umtx2 versions.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All-In-One pipelines:

These pipelines have everything you would want
What it runs: UMTX - ELF LOADER - FTP SERVER - WEB SERVER - ETAHEN (kstuff included) 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Jailbreak-ONLY pipelines

These pipelines are more simplified and has the minimal you need as fast as possible
What it runs: UMTX - ELF LOADER - ETAHEN (kstuff included) 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
NO-etaHEN pipelines

These pipelines are the same versions of the ones before, but without the etaHEN in the end, so theres no need for timing closing disk player so you wouldnt get kp.
What it runs: Everything until etahen.

This iso includes 4 options: pipeline loader, jar loader, usb elf loader and remote jar loader

jar files on the iso: 
umtx1.jar
umtx2.jar
elfloader.jar
etaHEN.jar
websrv.jar
ftpsrv.jar
spoofer_fortesting.jar (ps4 sdk spoofer already included in etahen so this is just for testing)
